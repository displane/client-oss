# Displane Client OSS

This is the open source client for Displane - a free digital signage management solution.

Displane approaches digital signage differently, by focusing purely on displaying websites on screens. 

Features include:

- Display multiple sites on a single screen
- Inject Javascript into displayed sites to login
- Schedule different scenes to load at different times
- RBAC to limit users to only see their own screens
- And many more

We primarily distribute Displane OSS through Balena.
